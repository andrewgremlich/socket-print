    <h2>File</h2>

    <p>Allows the user to open a file, clear a model, load a sample socket, or a test cylinder.</p>

    <h2>Edit</h2>

    <p>Allows changing material profile including: Name, Nozzle Temp, Cup Temp, Shrink Factor, and Output Factor.
      Changes
      to the material profile should be made with caution because they can affect the accuracy and strength of the
      socket.
      Material profiles can also be added and deleted.</p>

    <h2>Help</h2>

    <p>Displays Help document.</p>

    <h2>Info</h2>

    <p>Displays the version number.</p>

    <h2>IP Address</h2>

    <p>Allows the user to enter the printer IP address to establish connection with the printer.</p>

    <h2>Port Status</h2>

    <p>Indicates whether the port is connected or disconnected.</p>

    <h2>Lock Position</h2>

    <p>Indicates which side the release button hole in the cup should be on when loading the cup in the cup fixture.</p>

    <h2>Cup Size</h2>

    <p>Allows selection of the correct cup diameter and height.</p>

    <h2>Nozzle Size</h2>

    <p>Generally a 5 mm nozzle is used to print adult sockets.</p>

    <h2>Layer Height</h2>

    <p>A layer height of 1.0 mm (.040") might be typical and will be better at handling abrupt contour
      changes. Thicker layer heights will print faster, but should not be used with extreme overhangs.</p>

    <h2>Material</h2>

    <p>CP1 is the same polypropylene copolymer used to injection mold Provel Print Cups. This provides best adhesion
      between the cup and the socket. Polypropylene has been widely used for thermoplastic sockets since the 1980's. We
      use the same material previously used in our thermoformer preforms.</p>

    <h2>Nozzle Temp</h2>

    <p>Nozzle temperature in °C. Excessive nozzle heat can result in reduced dimensional accuracy. Insufficient nozzle
      temperature can cause poor layer to layer adhesion and reduced strength.</p>

    <p>Range: 160 - 260°C</p>

    <h2>Cup Temp</h2>

    <p>Nozzle temperature in °C. Insufficient cup temperature can cause poor adhesion and reduced
      strength. Range: 140 - 200°C</p>

    <h2>Shrink Factor</h2>

    <p>Corrects for normal shrinkage during cooling. Range: 0.1 - 4.0</p>

    <h2>Output Factor</h2>

    <p>This allows user correction for minor over or under extrusion. Range: 0.90 - 1.10</p>

    <h2>Density</h2>

    <p>Do not change this without consulting Provel.</p>

    <h2>Grams Per Revolution</h2>

    <p>Do not change this without consulting Provel.</p>

    <h2>Print Time</h2>

    <p>Shows estimated print time.</p>

    <h2>File</h2>

    <p>Sends the completed and sliced file to designated folder.</p>

    <h2>Print</h2>

    <p>Sends the completed and sliced file to the printer.</p>

    <h2>Rotate 90</h2>

    <p>Allows rotation of the socket in X, Y, and Z orientations.</p>

    <h2>Translate</h2>

    <p>Allows translation of the socket in X (left/right), Y (forward,back), and Z (up/down).</p>
