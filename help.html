    <p>ProvelPrint was designed for printing prosthetic sockets using Provel Print Cups and the Provel E2.20 Extrusion
      Printer. The user will import a residual limb shape file created by scanning patient anatomy or by casting the
      residual limb and digitizing with a cast digitizer. The resulting STL file will be imported into a prosthetic limb
      CAD
      program for modification. Once the necessary adjustments have been made, the shape is ready to open in
      ProvelPrint.
    </p>
    <h3>File</h3>
    <p>Allows the user to open a file, restore ProvelPrint default settings, clear a model, load a sample socket, or a
      test cylinder.</p>

    <h3>Edit</h3>
    <p>Allows changing material profile including: Name, Nozzle Temp, Cup Temp, Shrink Factor, and Output Factor, and
      Seconds Per Layer. Changes to the material profile should be made with caution because they can affect the
      accuracy and strength of the socket. Material profiles can also be added and deleted.</p>

    <h3>Help</h3>
    <p>Displays Help document.</p>

    <h3>Info</h3>
    <p>Displays the version number.</p>

    <h3>IP Address</h3>
    <p>Allows the user to enter the printer IP address to establish connection with the printer.</p>

    <h3>Port Status</h3>
    <p>Indicates whether the port is connected or disconnected.</p>

    <h3>Lock Position</h3>
    <p>Indicates which side the release button hole in the cup should be on when loading the cup in the cup fixture.</p>

    <h3>Cup Size</h3>
    <p>Allows selection of the correct cup diameter and height.</p>

    <h3>Nozzle Size</h3>
    <p>Generally a 5 mm nozzle will be used to print adult sockets.</p>

    <h3>Layer Height</h3>
    <p>A layer height of 1.0 mm (.040”) might be typical and will be better at handling abrupt contour changes. Thicker
      layer heights will print faster.</p>

    <h3>Material</h3>
    <p>CP1 is the same polypropylene copolymer used to injection mold Provel Print Cups. This provides best adhesion
      between the cup and the socket. Polypropylene has been widely used for thermoplastic sockets since the 1980’s. We
      use the same material previously used in our thermoformer preforms.</p>

    <h3>Nozzle Temp</h3>
    <p>Nozzle temperature in °C. Excessive nozzle heat can result in reduced dimensional accuracy. Insufficient nozzle
      temperature can cause poor layer to layer adhesion and reduced strength.</p>

    <h3>Cup Temp</h3>
    <p>Nozzle temperature in °C. Insufficient cup temperature can cause poor adhesion and reduced strength.</p>

    <h3>Shrink Factor</h3>
    <p>Corrects for normal shrinkage during cooling.</p>

    <h3>Output Factor</h3>
    <p>This allows user correction for minor over or under extrusion.</p>

    <h3>Seconds Per Layer</h3>
    <p>This allows adjustment in printing speed. Excessive speed can result in reduced dimensional accuracy.
      Insufficient speed can cause poor layer to layer adhesion and reduced strength.</p>

    <h3>Print Time</h3>
    <p>Shows estimated print time.</p>

    <h3>File</h3>
    <p>Sends the completed and sliced file to designated folder.</p>

    <h3>Print</h3>
    <p>Sends the completed and sliced file to the printer.</p>

    <h3>Rotate 90</h3>
    <p>Allows rotation of the socket in Coronal, Sagittal, and Transverse orientations.</p>

    <h3>Translate</h3>
    <p>Allows translation of the socket in X (left/right), Y (forward/back), and Z (up/down).</p>
